# Math Operators

		# 		**		Exponent			2 ** 3 = 8
		# 		%		Modulus/Remainder		22 % 8 = 6
		# 		//		Integer division		22 // 8 = 2
		# 		/		Division			22 / 8 = 2.75
		# 		*		Multiplication			3 * 3 = 9
		# 		-		Subtraction			5 - 2 = 3
		# 		+		Addition			2 + 2 = 4

# Comparison Operators

	# ==	Equal	x == y	
	# !=	Not equal	x != y	
	# >	Greater than	x > y	
	# <	Less than	x < y	
	# >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
	# <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

# Logical Operators

	# and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	
	# or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
	# not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)

# Membership Operators
	
	# in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	x in y	
	# not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y


# Boolean Values

	# Booleansrepresent one of two values: True or False.

a = 200
b = 33

if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not greater than a")

# meeste waarden zijn True

	# Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.
	# Any string is True, except empty strings.
	# Any number is True, except 0.
	# Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.
