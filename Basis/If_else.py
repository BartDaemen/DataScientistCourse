# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

#     Equals: a == b
#     Not Equals: a != b
#     Less than: a < b
#     Less than or equal to: a <= b
#     Greater than: a > b
#     Greater than or equal to: a >= b

# These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

# An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")

# The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")

# The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")

# short hand statement
if a > b: print("a is greater than b") 


a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")
